1.Strings are sequences in Python. This means they have many functions that arrays have in JavaScript. For example, len() and join().What type of error occurs if the join function for strings is called with some elements which are not strings?

_The correct answer is TypeError._

2.What is the latest stable version of Python?

_The best answer is 3.8. It can be found on the left side of the main documentation page (https://docs.python.org/3/) under the heading "Docs by version" and it is the highest number labelled with "(stable)"._

3.What is the Python equivalent to try...catch in Javascript?

_The correct answer is try...except. This can be found in the documentation by searching for "try catch" and scrolling down to the entry labelled "8. Errors and Exceptions". Section 8.3 clearly answers the question (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html?#handling-exceptions)._
