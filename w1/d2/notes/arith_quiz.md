1. What will `print(34 // 5)` print out?

the // operator performs integer division of 30 divided by 5. 5 can go into 34 a total of six times with a remainder of four.

2. What will `print(2 ** 3)` print out?

two to the power of three means two is multiplied by itself repeatedly so two is included three time. 2 times 2 times 2 is 8.

3. What will `print(9 ** 4)` print out?

The answer is 6561. The `**` operator performs exponentiation with numbers

4. What will `print(34 % 5)` print out?

the modulo operation results in the remainder of 34 divided by 5. 5 can go into 34 a total of six times with a remainder of four.

5. What will `print(5 / 2)` print out?

The answer is 2.5. The / operator performs division

6. What will `print(5 // 2)` print out?

The answer is 2. The // operator performs integer division which is similar to rounding down

7. What will `print(3 ** 2)` print out?

three to the power of two means multiplying three by itself. 3 times 3 is 9.

8. What will `print(8.0 / 2.0)` print out?

in Python, the type of number in the result will match the type of the starting numbers
