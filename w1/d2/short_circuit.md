By short circuiting we mean the stoppage of execution of boolean operation if the truth value of expression has been determined already. The evaluation of expression takes place from left to right. In python, short circuiting is supported by various boolean operators and functions.

Conditional expressions are evaluated from left to right. Python stops processing when it is certain of the outcome. This mean a False in an and series or a True value in an or series.
