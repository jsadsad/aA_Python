# It's time to put your knowledge of lists, tuples and dictionaries together. In this exercise, you will complete the basic statistics calculations for
# Minimum
# Maximum
# Mean
# Median
# Mode
# Follow the instructions in the code comments. Be sure to test your work by running your code!

# You will likely need to look at the Python documentation to complete this activity. (Search 'dictionary', go to 'Built-in Types', scroll down to 'Mapping Types - dict'.)

# After Step 1, you should see this in the terminal:
# ('min', 'max', 'mean', 'median', 'mode')
# (1, 9, 5.0, None, None)
# (12, 99, 43.666666666666664, None, None)

# In Step 2, the expected median values are 5 and 35.5. Median is the middle element. When the list has an odd length it's as easy as taking the value at the middle index on the sorted list. When the length is even, it's the average of the two numbers closest to the middle.

# In Step 3, the expected mode values are 1 and 23. Mode is the element which is most repeated.

# BONUS A is really whatever you want to do. It is recommended that you add fringe cases (e.g. a list of a single number like zero or all numbers are the same).

# BONUS B is to revisit the mode function and return nothing if more than one number is repeated the most number of times (like sample1). When successful, this would result in (1, 9, 5.0, 5, None) for the first call to analyze.


# STEP 1: Complete analyze function to return 5 values:
#    - minimum
#    - maximum
#    - mean (a.k.a. average)
#    - median (center point)
#    - mode (most repeated)
def analyze(nums):
    return (min(nums), max(nums), sum(nums) / len(nums), median(nums), mode(nums))


# STEP 2: Complete median function to return center number
#         WITHOUT using built-in function
def median(nums):
    # if there are no numbers, then exit right away
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return 0

    # sort numbers and find the middle
    orderedNums = sorted(nums)
    midIndex = len(orderedNums) // 2

    # if there's an odd number, use the number in the middle
    if len(orderedNums) % 2 == 1:
        return orderedNums[midIndex]

    # if there's an even number, use average of two elements in the middle
    return (orderedNums[midIndex] + orderedNums[midIndex - 1]) / 2


# STEP 3: Complete mode function to return most-repeated number
#         WITHOUT using built-in function
def mode(nums):
    # build a dictionary to track the element counts
    lookup = dict.fromkeys(nums, 0)
    for x in nums:
        lookup[x] += 1

    # make parallel arrays of the numbers (elements) and counts
    counts = list(lookup.values())
    elements = list(lookup.keys())

    # find the largest count and its position
    highCount = max(counts)
    highAt = counts.index(highCount)

    # BONUS B: Catch special case where more than one value repeats the most
    counts.sort()
    if len(nums) > 1 and (len(counts) == 1 or counts[-2] == highCount):
        return

    # mode is the number corresponding to the highest count
    return elements[highAt]


# DO NOT EDIT - sample data for checking your work
sample1 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
sample2 = [37, 45, 23, 65, 75, 34, 23, 23, 23, 65, 12, 99]

print(("min", "max", "mean", "median", "mode"))
print(analyze(sample1))
print(analyze(sample2))

# BONUS A: Print more samples as you see fit
print(analyze([0]))
print(analyze([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]))
